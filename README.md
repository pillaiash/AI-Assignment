# Ball Tracking in Video
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for tracking colored balls in a video. The notebook demonstrates how to detect and track balls of different colors, log their entry and exit events in various quadrants, and save the processed video along with a log file.

# Installation
To run the notebook, you need the following libraries:

-OpenCV
-NumPy
-Pandas
-MoviePy

# Results
The processed video will show the tracked balls with their respective colors and quadrants. Entry and exit events will be displayed with timestamps. A CSV log file will be generated containing the timestamp, quadrant number, ball color, and event type (entry or exit).

# Output Video 
An example output video is included in this repository. You can view the processed video to see how the tracking works and the overlays indicating the ball colors, their movements across quadrants, and timestamps of entry and exit events.
